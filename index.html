  <h2>The Evolution of the World Wide Web</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) can be regarded as one of the most remarkable technological developments in all of history. With the use of web browsers such as Google Chrome or Safari, people are able to readily access, retrieve, and view vast knowledge shared over the World Wide Web. Technologies such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and Uniform Resource Locator (URL) have jointly represented the “Web” to become what we know of it today.</p>
